- starts good
- error rate increases with the length of the session and code size and/or complexity
- unable to remember fixes and keep them applied
- "memory loss" with the length of the session and code size and/or complexity
- multiple retries to fix result in no changes or even worse results and damage to context/results
- complete falling apart by the end
